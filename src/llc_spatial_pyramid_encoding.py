        Lazebnik et al.'s publication "Beyond bags of features: spatial pyramid
        matching for recognizing natural scene categories" (2006 CVPR).
        Each of the 16 most inner arrays holds the features of a level 2 spatial
        bin. A level 1 spatial bin consists of all features of all level 2 bins
        that are part of the same inner list. The level 0 spatial bin consists
        of all features.
        Example:
        [[f0, f1, f2, f3], ..., [f12, f13, f14, f15]]
