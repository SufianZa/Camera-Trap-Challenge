        :param spatial_pyramid: A spatial pyramid of feature vectors, which is
        three layers deep. It is a nested list of 4 lists of 4 lists each of
        features. C.f. Lazebnik et al.'s publication "Beyond bags of features:
        spatial pyramid matching for recognizing natural scene categories" (2006
        CVPR).
        Each of the 16 most inner lists holds the features of a level 2 spatial
        bin. A level 1 spatial bin consists of all features of all level 2 bins
        that are part of the same inner list. The level 0 spatial bin consists
        of all features.
        Example:
        [[f0, f1, f2, f3], ..., [f12, f13, f14, f15]]
        The list of features f0 is a level 2 spatial bin, {f0, ..., f3} is a
        level 1 spatial bin and {f0, ..., f15} is the level 0 spatial bin.
        :param pooling: {'max' (default), 'sum'}
        The method used for pooling the locality-constrained linear codes of
        each feature. The supported pooling methods are max pooling (default)
        and sum pooling.
        :param normalization: {'eucl' (default), 'manh'}
        The method used for normalizing the pooled encoding. The euclidean norm
        (default) and manhattan norm are supported.
        :return: array of doubles
        The concatenation of the pooled and normalized codes for all 21 spatial
        bins. The first part corresponds to the level 0 bin, followed by level
        1, followed by level 2. In case of an error, None will be returned.
